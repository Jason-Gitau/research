            A weekend stay for a couple: KES 15,000 - KES 50,000+.
            Small event booking (e.g., birthday party, baby shower): KES 50,000 - KES 200,000+.
            Conferences/corporate retreats: KES 100,000 - KES 1,000,000+.
        Consistent Cash Flow: Driven by bookings, but prone to seasonality. Consistent marketing helps smooth this out.
        Understand Branding & Marketing: Visual appeal is paramount. Need to showcase ambiance, rooms, event setups, food, and happy guests.
        Content Creation/Lead Follow-up Pain: Difficult to continuously create captivating videos of the venue, special offers, or past events. Managing inquiries from different platforms and following up on quotes.

These businesses often have dedicated marketing budgets (even if small), are already aware of the importance of online presence, and are frustrated by the time and skill required to create engaging content. Your solution directly addresses these pains by automating high-quality video content and integrating lead nurturing, making the ROI very tangible for them.






You're asking the most critical question for any business idea: **"Who is my target market, and can they actually afford this?"**

Based on the proposed pricing (KES 8,000 - KES 80,000+ per month for your service, plus an initial setup fee), let's break down who in Kenya can realistically afford this and who might struggle.

### Who Can Afford These Figures in Kenya?

While the term "small business" is broad, your target audience isn't the *micro-enterprise* or the *hustler* just starting with KES 10,000. You're looking at **established Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)**, often those already generating decent revenue and who understand the value of marketing investment.

Here's a breakdown:

#### A. Established Small Businesses (Upper Tier of "Small" & "Medium")

These businesses typically:
* Have a physical location (or a well-established online presence).
* Have a few employees (5+).
* Generate consistent monthly revenue.
* Are already spending *some* money on marketing, even if it's just basic social media boosted posts or hiring a part-time content creator.
* Are feeling the pain of inconsistent content, lack of time, or inability to convert online engagement into tangible leads.

**Examples of Businesses that can likely afford KES 15,000 - KES 80,000 per month (including your fee and AI API costs):**

1.  **Mid-to-High End Restaurants & Cafes:**
    * **Why:** Competition is fierce, and visual appeal (food presentation, ambiance) is crucial. They constantly have new dishes, daily specials, happy hours, or events to promote. Many already spend on professional photography/videography sporadically or on social media management. A well-run restaurant can easily make KES 150,000 - KES 500,000+ monthly revenue.
    * **Examples:** Popular urban cafes, themed restaurants, upscale fast-food franchises, eateries with a strong delivery component. Think places in Kilimani, Westlands, Lavington, or well-established spots in other major towns.

2.  **Specialty Retail Stores (Boutiques, Electronics, Home Goods, Furniture):**
    * **Why:** They have new arrivals, sales, and unique products that benefit hugely from visual showcasing. They need to stand out from generic mass-market options. Many are already running Meta Ads campaigns.
    * **Examples:** Fashion boutiques in malls or upscale streets, stores selling imported electronics, unique home decor shops, art galleries, high-quality bespoke tailors.

3.  **Salons, Spas & Beauty Parlors (Established with good clientele):**
    * **Why:** Highly visual industry. Need to showcase hairstyles, nail art, makeup transformations, spa treatments. They often run promotions, seasonal packages, and seek to attract new clients consistently. They rely heavily on repeat business and referrals, which lead magnets can drive.
    * **Examples:** Popular salons in urban centers, standalone spa and wellness centers.

4.  **Event Planners / Decorators:**
    * **Why:** Their business is entirely visual. They need to showcase past events, decor themes, and service packages. They constantly bid for new clients and need a strong portfolio.
    * **Examples:** Event companies handling weddings, corporate functions, birthday parties.

5.  **Small Real Estate Agencies (Selling properties):**
    * **Why:** Property listings need dynamic visual tours. They need to generate leads for viewings and nurture them. While your AI won't generate a full house tour, it can create compelling "property spotlight" videos promoting a new listing or an open house. LinkedIn ads for these are expensive, but your service can offer a cost-effective alternative.
    * **Examples:** Agencies focusing on mid-tier to high-end residential or commercial properties.

6.  **Hotels, Guesthouses & Safari Camps (Small to Medium):**
    * **Why:** Crucial for showcasing rooms, amenities, dining, and experiences. They constantly promote special offers, weekend getaways, or holiday packages. Visuals are key to attracting tourists or local leisure seekers.
    * **Examples:** Boutique hotels in Nairobi, well-rated guesthouses in tourist towns, smaller safari camps.

7.  **Training & Consulting Firms (B2C focused):**
    * **Why:** Need to promote courses, workshops, and expert insights. Videos can be used for testimonials, short explainer videos, or promoting enrollment periods.
    * **Examples:** Professional development training centers, language schools, financial planning consultancies.

8.  **Automotive Service Centers / Car Dealers (Used Cars, Specialized Services):**
    * **Why:** Need to showcase cars for sale, specific services (e.g., detailing, specialized repairs), or promotions (e.g., free diagnostics).
    * **Examples:** Established car wash businesses offering premium services, independent garages specializing in particular car brands, used car dealerships.

#### B. Businesses Already Spending on Digital Marketing

The businesses already investing in digital marketing (either through agencies or Meta Ads directly) are your prime target. The search results indicate:
* **Most small businesses in Kenya spend between KES 15,000 – KES 50,000 per month on Meta ads.**
* **Medium-sized businesses typically invest KES 50,000 – KES 200,000 monthly.**
* **Freelancers for social media management: KES 15,000 - KES 70,000 per month.**
* **Digital Marketing Agencies: KES 50,000 - KES 250,000+ per month.**

**Your sweet spot is offering a solution that is:**
* **More effective than just boosted posts** (due to video and lead nurturing).
* **More affordable than a full-service agency** (for similar content output).
* **Significantly less effort than doing it themselves.**

### Can Small Businesses *Really* Afford This?

**Yes, the right kind of small business can, and *will* afford this if you clearly demonstrate the ROI.**

* **Not all small businesses are created equal.** A "micro-enterprise" (e.g., a roadside fruit vendor, a small kiosk owner making KES 30,000 - KES 100,000 monthly profit) will likely struggle with your base KES 8,000 fee. They need ultra-low-cost, direct cash-generating marketing.
* **Focus on businesses that:**
    * **Have a high average customer value.** If one new customer brings KES 5,000 - KES 10,000+ in revenue, then even generating just 2-3 new customers per month through your system makes the KES 8,000 - KES 15,000 entry-level fee justifiable.
    * **Have a consistent cash flow.** They don't operate hand-to-mouth.
    * **Understand the value of branding and consistent marketing.** They see it as an investment, not just an expense.
    * **Are already struggling with content creation and lead follow-up.** Your system directly solves these pains.

**Your initial setup fee (KES 150,000 - KES 300,000 for MVP) might be a larger hurdle for many, so consider:**
* **Flexible payment terms for the setup fee:** e.g., 50% upfront, 50% on completion.
* **A "Pilot Program" where a few select businesses get a discounted setup fee in exchange for testimonials and case studies.** This helps you refine your offering and gather compelling evidence.
* **Focus on the monthly subscription model as the primary value proposition**, making it easier for them to get started. The initial setup fee is for customization and integration.

**In conclusion:** You are targeting the **established, growth-oriented Kenyan SMEs** in sectors that heavily rely on visual appeal and customer acquisition, and who are already allocating a budget (or struggling with the lack of one) for digital marketing. By positioning your service as a highly efficient, automated, and ROI-driven alternative to traditional content creation and lead nurturing, you tap into a segment that genuinely needs and can afford your solution.







This is an excellent question and crucial for any successful business model. Small businesses in Kenya are highly price-sensitive but willing to invest if they see a clear, high return on investment (ROI). Let's break down the budget and ROI guarantee.

### 1. Cost Components for the Business Owner

We'll categorize this into **Initial Setup Cost (to you)** and **Ongoing Operational Costs**.

#### A. Initial Setup & Customization (What they pay you to build)

This is your one-time fee for building the custom n8n workflow and initial setup.

* **Your Development Fee (Custom N8N Workflow + UI):** This is the largest component and depends heavily on the complexity of the workflow, the richness of the UI, and your experience.
    * **Basic Prototype/MVP (Minimal Viable Product):** If you're building a very streamlined version for initial clients.
        * *Estimate:* KES 150,000 - KES 300,000 (approx. $1,100 - $2,200 USD). This would cover core video generation, simple social posting, and a basic lead capture to Google Sheets.
    * **Advanced System (with WhatsApp/SMS & more integrations):** For a more comprehensive solution as described.
        * *Estimate:* KKES 300,000 - KES 800,000+ (approx. $2,200 - $6,000+ USD). This includes localized AI voices, more sophisticated lead nurturing, deeper analytics, and a more polished UI.
    * **Factors affecting this:** Your experience, features requested, complexity of UI, number of integrations, time required.
* **Domain & Basic Hosting for UI (if custom):**
    * *Estimate:* KES 2,000 - KES 5,000 per year (for a simple landing page/form).
* **Initial Training & Onboarding:**
    * *Included in your development fee or a small add-on:* KES 10,000 - KES 30,000.

#### B. Ongoing Operational Costs (Monthly/Usage-Based)

This is what the business owner pays regularly to keep the system running and for usage of the AI models. This is where your recurring revenue comes from.

1.  **Your Service Fee (Maintenance & Support / Tiered Subscription):**
    * This is your primary recurring income from clients. You'd offer tiered plans based on usage, features, and support.
    * **Basic Plan (e.g., 10-15 videos/month):** KES 8,000 - KES 15,000 per month (approx. $60 - $110 USD). Includes basic video generation, posting to 2-3 platforms, Google Sheet lead capture.
    * **Standard Plan (e.g., 20-30 videos/month + WhatsApp nurturing):** KES 18,000 - KES 35,000 per month (approx. $130 - $260 USD). Includes localized voices, more platforms, limited WhatsApp/SMS nurturing.
    * **Premium Plan (e.g., 40+ videos/month + advanced nurturing):** KES 40,000 - KES 80,000+ per month (approx. $300 - $600+ USD). Includes higher volumes, priority support, deeper integrations, more extensive nurturing.
    * **What this covers from your end:**
        * N8N workflow maintenance & updates.
        * Monitoring API usage and replenishing tokens.
        * Troubleshooting and support for the business.
        * Potentially managing their social media accounts within the system.

2.  **External API Costs (Usage-Based - "Discounts & Other Expenses")**
    * These are the costs for the actual AI services and messaging, which you'll either pass through directly or mark up within your tiered pricing.
    * **AI Text Generation (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5/4o Mini):**
        * **GPT-3.5 Turbo:** ~ $0.50 per 1M input tokens, $1.50 per 1M output tokens.
        * **GPT-4o Mini:** ~ $0.15 per 1M input tokens, $0.60 per 1M output tokens.
        * *Estimate:* For 20-30 short scripts per month, this cost is minimal, likely **KES 100 - KES 500 ($0.75 - $3.75) per month**, depending on script length and model used.
    * **AI Video Generation (e.g., Invideo AI, KreadoAI, Luma Dream Machine, RunwayML):**
        * Pricing varies significantly. Some are per-video, some per-second.
        * *Examples:*
            * Google Veo 2: $0.10-$0.30/video (for 5-8 seconds)
            * Luma Dream Machine: $0.25/video (for 12 seconds)
            * RunwayML Gen-4: $0.20/second
            * KreadoAI/Invideo.ai: Might have tiered plans or per-minute rates.
        * *Estimate (for 20-30 videos, 15-30 sec each):* **KES 2,000 - KES 10,000+ ($15 - $75+) per month**, depending on resolution, length, and chosen provider. This will be the most variable and potentially highest external cost.
    * **AI Voice Generation (if separate from video API, or for custom Kenyan voices):**
        * OpenAI TTS: ~ $15 per 1M characters (for high quality).
        * *Estimate:* For 20-30 short voiceovers, likely **KES 100 - KES 500 ($0.75 - $3.75) per month**.
    * **WhatsApp/SMS API (e.g., Twilio, HostPinnacle, BulkSMSKenya):**
        * **Twilio WhatsApp:** ~$0.005 per message (Twilio fee) + Meta's conversation-based fee (varies by type, e.g., marketing ~$0.025 per conversation). *For Kenya, local providers might be cheaper.*
        * **Local SMS APIs (Kenya):** KES 0.20 - KES 1.00 per SMS (depending on volume).
        * *Estimate (for 100-500 WhatsApp messages/SMS per month):* **KES 500 - KES 3,000 ($3.75 - $22.50) per month**, depending on message volume, type, and provider.
    * **N8N Self-Hosting (VPS):**
        * While n8n itself is free to self-host, you need a server.
        * *Estimate:* KES 700 - KES 3,000 ($5 - $25) per month for a basic Virtual Private Server (VPS) from DigitalOcean, Hetzner, etc. (Kenyan hosting providers might have similar rates).
    * **Lead Capture Landing Page Hosting (if not part of your main UI):**
        * Could be free with services like Google Forms, or part of your main UI.
        * Dedicated landing page builders can be $40-$200/month, but you can build simple ones within n8n or use free tools. *Assume minimal if integrated.*

**Summary of Estimated Monthly Operational Costs (to you, for one client, passed through):**

* **AI APIs (Text, Video, Voice):** KES 2,200 - KES 11,000+ ($16.50 - $82.50+)
* **Messaging (WhatsApp/SMS):** KES 500 - KES 3,000 ($3.75 - $22.50)
* **N8N VPS:** KES 700 - KES 3,000 ($5 - $22.50)
* **Total Raw API/Hosting Costs (per client): KES 3,400 - KES 17,000+ ($25.50 - $127.50+)**

You would bundle these raw costs into your tiered subscription plans, ensuring you have a healthy profit margin for your time, expertise, maintenance, and support.

### 2. How are they Guaranteed their ROI?

"Guaranteeing" ROI in marketing is tricky, as it depends on many factors outside your control (the business's product, pricing, customer service, market demand, competition, ad spend etc.). However, you can provide a **strong ROI *proposition* and demonstrate potential ROI** by focusing on:

#### A. Quantifiable Value & Metrics:

1.  **Time Savings:**
    * **Calculation:** *Current time spent on social media content creation (manual) vs. Time spent using your system.*
    * **Example:** "A typical small business spends 10-20 hours a month creating social media content, editing videos, and scheduling. At KES 500/hour for staff time, that's KES 5,000 - KES 10,000 saved per week, or KES 20,000 - KES 40,000 per month."
    * **Your Value:** Your system reduces this to minutes per week.
    * **ROI Metric:** Time saved / Cost of your service.

2.  **Lead Generation & Conversion:**
    * **Calculation:** *Number of new leads captured via your lead magnets x Average Lead Value (ALV) - Your Service Cost.*
    * **Average Lead Value (ALV):** Help them calculate this. "What's the average revenue you get from a new customer? How many leads do you need to get one new customer?" If 10 leads convert to 1 customer worth KES 5,000, then each lead is worth KES 500.
    * **Your Value:** Your system consistently generates leads and nurtures them through WhatsApp/SMS.
    * **ROI Metric:** (Revenue from system-generated leads - Cost of your service) / Cost of your service.
    * **Example:** "If your system generates 50 leads/month, and 10% convert to customers, that's 5 new customers. If each customer brings KES 5,000 in revenue, that's KES 25,000 in direct revenue. If your service costs KES 15,000, that's an ROI of (25,000 - 15,000) / 15,000 = 66% (or 1.66:1 return)."

3.  **Increased Engagement & Reach:**
    * **Calculation:** *Higher video views, shares, comments, profile visits.* While harder to directly monetize, these build brand awareness, which is a precursor to sales.
    * **Your Value:** High-quality, engaging, localized video content outperforms static posts.
    * **ROI Metric:** Increased reach/engagement leading to improved brand recognition and potential long-term sales.

4.  **Reduced Marketing Agency Costs:**
    * **Calculation:** *Cost of hiring a social media manager/agency vs. Your service cost.*
    * **Context in Kenya:** Social media marketing agencies in Kenya typically charge KES 50,000 - KES 200,000+ per month (for SMEs, excluding ad spend). Freelancers are KES 15,000 - KES 70,000.
    * **Your Value:** Your automated system offers a more affordable alternative to a full-service agency while providing similar (or better, due to video focus) results.
    * **ROI Metric:** (Agency Cost - Your Service Cost) / Agency Cost.

#### B. Transparency and Reporting:

* **Dashboards & Reports:** Provide clear, automated reports (e.g., weekly/monthly) showing:
    * Number of videos generated and posted.
    * Total reach/impressions across platforms.
    * Number of clicks on lead magnet links.
    * Number of new leads captured.
    * Number of WhatsApp/SMS messages sent.
    * Key engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares).
* **Performance Review Meetings:** Regularly review these reports with the business owner, helping them understand the data and strategize for future campaigns. This builds trust and shows your commitment to their success.

#### C. Performance-Based Incentives (Optional, for higher tiers):

* For premium clients, you could offer a slight discount or bonus for hitting certain lead generation or revenue targets. This aligns your success with theirs.
* "If we generate X leads this month, your next month's fee is Y% off."

#### D. Testimonials and Case Studies:

* As you acquire early clients, document their successes. Create case studies showing their "before and after" metrics. This is the most powerful way to guarantee ROI to future clients.
* "Mama Mboga increased her daily customer walk-ins by 15% in the first month using our AI video system, leading to KES 10,000 extra revenue!"

#### E. Iterative Improvement & Adaptation:

* **Your Commitment:** Emphasize that digital marketing is dynamic. You will continually monitor performance, adapt the AI models (e.g., for new trends, better Kenyan language understanding), and optimize the workflows to ensure ongoing ROI.
* **Feedback Loop:** Encourage clients to provide feedback so you can fine-tune the system for their specific needs.

### Example ROI Pitch:

"Mr. / Ms. Business Owner, think about this:

* **Current Pain:** You're spending hours trying to create social media content, and it often doesn't convert into actual customers. Or you're paying a human social media manager KES 50,000+ a month, but you're not sure what you're getting.
* **Our Solution:** For just KES [Your Monthly Fee], our AI-powered system does the work of a dedicated content creator and a lead generation specialist.
* **The Math:** Let's say our system costs you KES 25,000 a month.
    * It saves you 15 hours of content creation time (worth KES 7,500 if your time is valued at KES 500/hour).
    * More importantly, it generates 30 new leads for you every month. Even if only 10% of those leads become customers (3 new customers), and each customer spends KES 10,000 on average over their lifetime, that's KES 30,000 in new revenue directly attributable to our system.
    * **Your ROI:** (KES 30,000 revenue + KES 7,500 time saved) - KES 25,000 cost = KES 12,500 net profit. This is a 50% ROI *per month* ($12,500 / $25,000 * 100%).
* **The Guarantee (or rather, the Confidence):** We provide detailed reports, show you the leads, and help you track your sales. Our goal is to make sure the money you put in comes back to you, and then some. We believe in our system's ability to drive tangible results for your business, allowing you to focus on what you do best: serving your customers."

By clearly outlining costs, highlighting quantifiable benefits, and providing transparent reporting, you can build a compelling case for businesses to invest in your system, demonstrating a very high potential ROI tailored to the Kenyan market's needs.












Let's break down the video generation and social media posting process in your n8n workflow, step-by-step, from the user's input to the final post on all platforms.

Imagine this as a series of connected "nodes" in your n8n workflow, each performing a specific task.

---

### Phase 1: User Input & Trigger

1.  **User Interface (UI) / Input Form (Node 1 - Trigger):**
    * **What it is:** This is the entry point for the business owner. It could be a simple web form (e.g., built with basic HTML/CSS, a tool like Typeform linked to n8n, or even a custom UI you develop).
    * **User Action:** The business owner *writes something* (e.g., "New delicious beef stew available today!") or *posts a picture* of their product (e.g., a photo of the beef stew). They might also select the "type" of video (e.g., product spotlight, daily deal, service promo) and choose which social media platforms they want to post to.
    * **N8N Trigger:** This UI sends a "trigger" signal to your n8n workflow, usually via a **Webhook node**. This webhook receives all the data the user inputted (text, image URL, selected platforms).

---

### Phase 2: AI Script Generation

2.  **AI Script Generation (Node 2 - AI Model Interaction):**
    * **What it is:** This node uses an AI model (like a large language model, e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 via OpenAI's API, or even a local open-source model if self-hosting) to craft the narrative for the video.
    * **Input to AI:** The text provided by the user, combined with pre-defined "prompt engineering" instructions you've embedded in the workflow. These instructions tell the AI:
        * "You are a marketing assistant for small businesses."
        * "Generate a short (30-60 second) video script for a social media ad promoting [user's product/service]."
        * "Include a clear call to action."
        * "Use a persuasive and engaging tone suitable for [selected business type - e.g., restaurant, retail]."
        * "Incorporate keywords like 'delicious,' 'limited offer,' 'visit us today' (based on user input or defaults)."
        * *Crucially:* "Use language and phrases common in Kenyan English, reflecting the local culture." (This is where the fine-tuning for Kenya comes in).
    * **Output from AI:** A structured script, including:
        * Video scenes/visual cues (e.g., "Scene 1: Close-up of the beef stew steaming. Scene 2: Happy customer eating. Scene 3: Business exterior with contact info.")
        * Dialogue/Voiceover text (e.g., "Craving authentic Kenyan flavors? Our new Beef Stew Special is here! Made with tender, slow-cooked beef and aromatic spices, it's a taste sensation you won't forget. Don't miss out – visit [Restaurant Name] today or call to order!").
        * Suggested on-screen text overlays.
        * Call to action text.

### Phase 3: AI Video Generation

3.  **AI Video Generation (Node 3 - Video API Interaction):**
    * **What it is:** This is the core "magic" node where the actual video is pieced together using the script and the user's image. This will involve integrating with a specialized AI video generation API (e.g., Invideo AI, KreadoAI, Pictory.AI, or a local solution using frameworks like Stable Diffusion/Sora-like models if you have the computational power and expertise).
    * **Inputs to Video AI:**
        * The **script** generated in the previous step.
        * The **user's product image**.
        * Pre-defined **video templates/styles** you've chosen for the business type (e.g., a "restaurant promo" template, a "fashion boutique" template). These templates dictate aspects like music, transitions, font styles, and overall visual aesthetic.
        * **AI Voice Selection:** You'll specify which AI voice to use (e.g., one with a Kenyan accent if available, or a standard engaging voice).
    * **Process within the Video AI (High-Level):**
        * **Image Processing:** The AI service receives the user's product image. It might perform background removal, enhancement, or object detection to place it appropriately within the video scene.
        * **Visual Generation/Selection:** Based on the script's visual cues, the AI either:
            * **Generates new visuals:** Creates scenes from scratch using text-to-image/video models (e.g., if the script says "happy customer," it might generate a generic happy customer scene).
            * **Selects stock footage:** Pulls relevant clips from its internal library to match the script's themes.
            * **Animates the product image:** Zooms, pans, rotates, or overlays text/graphics onto the user's static product image to make it dynamic.
        * **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** The dialogue/voiceover text from the script is fed into a Text-to-Speech engine. This engine generates an audio file using the selected AI voice.
        * **Synchronization:** The AI synchronizes the generated visuals, the voiceover, the background music, and any on-screen text overlays to create a cohesive video.
        * **Captioning:** Automatically generates captions/subtitles from the voiceover text and embeds them into the video.
    * **Output from Video AI:** A final, rendered video file (e.g., MP4 format) and potentially a direct URL to where the video is hosted on their servers.

### Phase 4: Lead Magnet & Tracking (Optional but Recommended for ROI)

4.  **Lead Magnet Link Generation (Node 4 - Link Management/Database):**
    * **What it is:** This node dynamically creates a unique link that viewers will click on to get the promised lead magnet (e.g., a discount code, a free guide, sign-up for a loyalty program).
    * **Input:** Details about the lead magnet (e.g., "10% off first order").
    * **Output:** A short, unique URL (e.g., `yourdomain.com/coupon/xyz123`). This URL is crucial for tracking.
    * **Mechanism:** This link might direct to a simple landing page or a form. When the user interacts with it, their contact information (e.g., WhatsApp number) is captured.

5.  **Lead Data Storage (Node 5 - Database/Google Sheet Integration):**
    * **What it is:** When a user clicks the lead magnet link and provides their details, this node captures that information.
    * **Input:** User contact info (name, phone, email, date/time, source platform, lead magnet ID).
    * **Output:** Adds a new row to a Google Sheet (or a more sophisticated CRM) with the lead details. This creates a tangible list for the business owner.

### Phase 5: Social Media Posting

6.  **Social Media Posting (Nodes 6, 7, 8... - Platform-Specific Integrations):**
    * **What it is:** A series of nodes, one for each social media platform (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter). Each node connects to the respective platform's API.
    * **Inputs to Posting Nodes:**
        * The **rendered video file** (or its URL) from Node 3.
        * The **social media caption** (can be AI-generated from the script, or a refined version, with platform-specific hashtags).
        * The **lead magnet URL** from Node 4 (often placed in the caption or profile bio for Instagram/TikTok).
        * The business's authenticated social media accounts for each platform.
    * **Process in Each Node:**
        * **Platform-Specific Optimization:** The n8n workflow can be configured to make slight adjustments for each platform:
            * **Instagram/Facebook:** Posts the video, caption, and potentially tags relevant accounts. For Instagram, the lead magnet link might be explicitly stated to be in the "link in bio."
            * **TikTok:** Posts the video, short caption, and trending hashtags. May trim the video to TikTok's preferred length.
            * **X/Twitter:** Posts the video and a concise, tweet-length caption with the link.
            * **LinkedIn:** Posts the video with a more professional caption suitable for business networking.
        * **API Calls:** Each node makes the necessary API calls to its respective social media platform to upload the video and text.
    * **Output:** The video is successfully posted on each selected social media platform, with the generated caption and lead magnet call to action.

### Phase 6: Lead Nurturing (Optional but Highly Recommended for ROI)

7.  **WhatsApp/SMS Nurturing (Node X - Messaging API Integration):**
    * **What it is:** This node is triggered *after* a lead provides their contact information (from Node 5). It sends automated messages.
    * **Input:** The lead's phone number and the lead magnet they received.
    * **Process:**
        * **Initial Message:** Immediately sends the promised lead magnet (e.g., "Hi [Name], here's your 10% off code: DISCOUNT123. Enjoy your meal at [Restaurant Name]!").
        * **Follow-up Messages (Delayed):** Uses n8n's "Wait" nodes to send subsequent messages after a delay (e.g., 24 hours, 3 days):
            * "Just a friendly reminder, your discount code expires soon!"
            * "We'd love to hear your feedback! What's your favorite item on our menu?"
            * "Did you know we also offer [related service]? Check out our specials here: [link]."
    * **Output:** Direct, automated communication with potential customers, moving them closer to a purchase.

**In Summary, for the business owner:**

1.  They provide an image and some text.
2.  Your n8n workflow takes over:
    * It uses AI to write a compelling script.
    * It uses another AI to turn that script and image into a professional video with a voiceover and captions.
    * It generates a special link for a discount or offer.
    * It then posts this video, with the generated caption and offer link, to all their chosen social media platforms simultaneously.
    * *If the lead nurturing is active:* When someone engages with that offer, they automatically receive follow-up messages on WhatsApp/SMS.

This entire process, which would normally take hours of content creation and manual posting, is condensed into minutes, requiring minimal input from the business owner, hence the high ROI from a time-saving and lead-generating perspective.
